*What is the problem?*

In India, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, during medical emergencies people suffer because:

They do not know the nearest hospital or their availability.

They cannot quickly find the right doctor for the specific issue.

They waste time searching for medicine shops.

Language barriers make emergency apps difficult for rural citizens.

There is no quick way to share personal info to hospitals after an accident.


Who is impacted?

Accident victims

Elderly people

Patients in rural areas

People with sudden health issues (heart attack, asthma, etc.)

Tourists or travelers unfamiliar with the area
